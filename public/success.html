<p>The power of the Internet is our communities.  If we want to change stories, build movements, and connect, we have to grow <em>us</em> again.

<p>So invite others who you want to be involved — because <strong><em>you lead this too.</em></strong>

<p><strong>And that's why this will be different.</strong>

<p style="line-height:29px">You can invite people via <a href="mailto:?subject=A%20low-tech%20social%20media%20cooperative%2C%20want%20to%20join%3F&body=This%20is%20a%20cool%20project%20I%20found%20%E2%80%93%20https%3A%2F%2Fgroundtalk.land.%20%20Here%20are%20more%20details%2C%20anybody%20can%20join%2C%20and%20I%20wanted%20to%20invite%20some%20people%20who%20I%20want%20to%20be%20part%20of%20this%20...%0A%0AWe%20need%20low%20and%20resilient%20infrastructures.%20%20We%20need%20our%20own%20social%20media%20and%20networks%2C%20if%20we%20want%20them.%0A%0AAnd%20we%20need%20to%20organize%20to%20make%20it%20happen.%0A%0AWant%20a%20network%20for%20ourselves%20%E2%80%94%20built%20for%20low-energy%20and%20resilience%2C%20led%20by%20workers%20and%20people%2C%20in%20service%20of%20the%20worlds%20we%20want%20to%20make%3F%0A%0AJoin%20to%20get%20involved%2C%20at%20one%20of%20the%20smallest%20websites%20on%20the%20Internet%3A%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fgroundtalk.land">✉️ email</a>,
